            This application allows two Android devices to carry out two-way text chat over
            Bluetooth Low Energy or Classic Bluetooth. It demonstrates all the fundamental
            BluetoothLE API capabilites, such as:
              (1) Scanning for other Bluetooth devices
              (2) Discovering BLE nearby devices that are advertising
              (3) Advertise the Chat service to nearby devices
              (4) Querying the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
              (5) Establishing RFCOMM channels/sockets
              (6) Connecting to a remote device
              (7) Transfering data over Bluetooth
